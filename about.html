  <P>Travel and Tourism are as old as mankind on earth. Man at beginning of his existence roamed about the surface of the earth in search of food, shelter, security and better habitat. However, in course of time, such movements were transformed into wanderlust</P>.
  <P>
    After that, the Indian government took many various incentives for the development of Indian tourism through tourism policies, economic reforms. Various committees were created for tourism development and separately dedicated ministries and tourism organizations established.
